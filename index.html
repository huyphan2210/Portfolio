        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Huy and I'm from Vietnam. I first started with web development back in 2021 when I decided to build a React app for my graduation project. I had never built a web app before so I was kinda nervous - turns out deciding how the UI/UX should be looked and how the logic works taught me a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL.
          <br/><br/>
          I had the opportunity to work for a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. When I was there, I took part in building 2 web applications called Agora-colearning and Vibe using Javascript frameworks and some third-party applications. I also learned Typescript during the time.
          <br/><br/>
          My main focus these days is trying to be a well-rounded software developer. Not only in programming, I'm also trying to learn more about business analyzing as well. I'm reading books which can make me a better developer such as <i>The Pragmmatic Programmer, An Introduction to Algorithms, </i>etc.

        <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

        <h3><a style="color: white;" href="https://tpssoft.com/" target="_blank">TPS Sotware Solutions</a> (January, 2022 - December, 2022)</h3>
        <p>
          I was very nervous about this job because this was the first time I had started my career and I worried that I would make mistakes. It turned out making mistakes was expected if you're an intern and you had no experiences whatsoever. I learned a lot from my mistakes during this time and also know how a developer works - it's not just coding but also lots of meetings, plannings, teamworks etc. I also took part in two projects - <i>Agora Colearning</i> and <i>Vibe</i> when I was here.
